# 2nd International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories for Software Architecture (MSR4SA'22)  

- Co-located with [ECSA 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecsa-2022) 
- Please note that there is an option that the conference will go fully online if required.
- September, 2022

## Theme & Goals
Mining software repositories (MSR) became essential to support several software architectural design activities, such as architectural recovery, architectural knowledge capturing, mining architectural tactics, etc. Nevertheless, MSR to support software architecture (SA) is a challenging task, which requires expertise and focus. Moreover, MSR and SA are two separate communities with a small intersection. On the one hand, SA researchers are concerned with proposing approaches to support architectural activities. On the other hand, the MSR community exploits different software repositories, and applies systematically many data mining techniques.

The goal of MSR4SA is to gather researchers and practitioners from both the MSR and SA communities to create the starting point for a dedicated research community, which focusses on applying MSR techniques to resolve architectural problems. Moreover, we aim to create the first future research agenda for the research area of MSR for SA.

**Mining Architectural Information to Stem Technical Debt** - Software engineers tend to document their systems’ architectures sporadically and superficially. Additionally, engineers frequently neglect to carefully consider the architectural impact of their changes to a system’s implementation. As a result, an existing system’s architecture will over time deviate from the engineers’ intent, and it will decay through unplanned introduction of new and/or invalidation of existing design decisions. Technical debt accumulates through architectural decay, increasing the cost of making modifications to a system and decreasing the system’s dependability. In this talk, I will focus on isolating three types of architectural information from the details readily available about a system’s implementation: architectural design decisions, change, and decay. I will show how this information can be used to identify the locations in a software system’s implementation that reflect the architectural decay, the points in a system’s lifetime when that decay tends to occur, and the reasons why it occurs. I will show how architectural decay tends to correlate with the occurrence of commonly reported implementation-level issues, and how it can be predicted. Finally, I will identify steps that engineers can take to manage the accumulated technical debt by stemming and reversing the decay. Data obtained by analyzing hundreds of versions of several well-known systems — Android, Hadoop, Cassandra, Struts, etc. — will be used to illustrate the discussion throughout.
## Workshop Program 

- Ilaria Pigazzini , Davide Foppiani and Francesca Arcelli Fontana. **Two different facets of architectural smells criticality: an empirical study** - Architectural smells (AS) represent symptoms of problems at architectural level that have an impact on architectural debt. It is important to identify among them the most critical ones, so that developers can prioritize them for their removal. In order to evaluate the criticality of AS, in this paper we consider two facets: the PageRank metric, to assess the centrality of a smell in a project, and Severity, a metric to estimate the cost-solving of smells. We have proposed these two metrics in a previous work and here we perform an empirical analysis of the evolution and correlation of these metrics in the version history of 10 projects (at least 22 versions each, 264 projects in total). The analysis of the evolution is useful in order to identify which architectural smells types tend to become more critical. The analysis of the correlation is useful to study whether the criticality of a smell has an influence on how much it costs to remove it, and vice-versa.
- Carlos Paradis , Rick Kazman. **Design Choices in Building an MSR Tool: The Case of Kaiaulu** - Background: Since Alitheia Core was proposed and subsequently retired, tools that support empirical studies of software continue to be proposed, such as Codeface, Codeface4Smells, GrimoireLab and SmartSHARK, but they all make different design choices with overlapping functionality. Aims: We seek to understand the design decisions adopted on these tools– good and bad–and their consequences to understand why their authors reinvented functionality already present in other tools, and to help inform the design of future tools. Method: We used action research to evaluate the tools, and determine principles and anti-patterns to motivate a new tool design. Results: We identified 7 major design choices among the tools: 1) Abstraction Debt, 2) the use of Project Configuration Files, 3) the choice of Batch or Interactive Mode, 4) Minimal Paths to Data, 5) Familiar Software Abstractions, 6) Licensing and 7) the Perils of Code Reuse. Building on the observed good and bad design decisions, we created our own architecture and implemented it as an R package. Conclusions: Tools should not require onerous setup for users to obtain data. Authors should consider the conventions and abstractions used by their chosen language and build upon these instead of redefining them. Tools should encourage best practices in experiment reproducibility by leveraging self-contained and readable schemas that are used for tool automation, and reuse must be done with care to avoid depending on dead code.
