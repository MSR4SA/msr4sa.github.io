# 1st International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories for Software Architecture (MSR4SA'21)  

- Co-located with [ECSA 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecsa-2021) 
- Virtual
- September, 2021

## Theme & Goals
Mining software repositories (MSR) became essential to support several software architectural design activities, such as architectural recovery, architectural knowledge capturing, mining architectural tactics, etc. Nevertheless, MSR to support software architecture (SA) is a challenging task, which requires expertise and focus. Moreover, MSR and SA are two separate communities with a small intersection. On the one hand, SA researchers are concerned with proposing approaches to support architectural activities. On the other hand, the MSR community exploits different software repositories, and applies systematically many data mining techniques.

The goal of MSR4SA is to gather researchers and practitioners from both the MSR and SA communities to create the starting point for a dedicated research community, which focusses on applying MSR techniques to resolve architectural problems. Moreover, we aim to create the first future research agenda for the research area of MSR for SA.

## Topics of Interest

MSR4SA 2021 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following topics related to MSR and software architecture:
- Analysis of challenges in applying MSR for SA
- Datasets for software architecture
- Machine learning techniques for mining software architectures
- Natural language processing for software architecture
- Software architecture in DevOps
- Qualitative studies on software repositories, regarding software architecture
- Use cases and case studies on applying MSR for SA
- Processes and tools supporting the development of approaches to MSR for SA
- State-of-the-art analysis which relates MSR and SA
- Best practices and lessons learned for applying MSR for SA
- Mining and integrating multiple data sources for software architecture
- Mining software repositories for assessing architectural technical debt
- Mining software repositories for architectural analysis
- Mining architectural tactics
- Mining architectural patterns and styles
- Mining reference architectures
- Architecture visualization from software repositories
- Integration of structured and unstructured data for software architecture 
- Mining architectural knowledge, decisions, and rationale
- Mining software repositories for non-functional quality attributes
- Mining software ecosystems and systems-of-systems
- Foundational principles of MSR for SA
- Mining architecturally-relevant requirements
- MSR and architecture description languages
- Mining architecture views and viewpoints
- Mining microservice-based systems
- Systematic literature reviews on MSR for SA
- Empirical studies on MSR for SA
- Industrial experiences and challenges on MSR for SA
- Model-Driven Engineering techniques for MSR for SA

## Workshop Program 

TBA

## Submission Guidelines 

Prospective participants are invited to submit:
- Research papers presenting novel contributions on mining software repositories for software architecture (max. 10 pages);
- Industry papers which shows the application and challenges of MSR techniques for SA (max. 6 pages)
- Dataset and tool papers on MSR for SA (max. 6 pages)

Workshop papers must follow the two-column [CEUR-ART style] (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip) Format and Submission Guidelines. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EasyChair workshop website. All accepted papers will be published at [CEUR] (http://ceur-ws.org). After the workshop, we will organize post-proceedings of selected and extended papers of workshops that will be published in a Springer LNCS volume (16 to 18 pages). Candidate papers for post-proceedings will be identified by the reviewers and the workshop chairs, based on the paper quality and its relevance to the workshop. Workshop papers submitted for the post-proceedings will undergo an additional review cycle. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the  [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=msr4sa2021).

In addition to the workshop publications, we aim to publish the first research agenda to MSR for SA. This will be based on the discussions within the MSR4SA 2021 workshop, and thus all workshop participants will be included as authors in a joint publication.

## Important Dates
